### Why Should You Learn Functional Programming

#### How I Started Learning Functional Programming

Two years back (in the early 2012) when I started learning `LINQ` in `C#` I came across the word called **Functional Programming**. 
To be honest it took me quite some time to understand how functional programming works in the context of `LINQ`. 
While coding in `LINQ`, I have started realizing the beauty and expressiveness of functional way of programming. 

After seeing the benefits of `LINQ` in my day to day coding, I've started researching more and more about functional programming and landed in the Haskell world! Though I didn't learn it fully, [the book](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) which I've used to learn Haskell has given me more insights about thinking functionally to solve real time problems. 

I am really inspired by this new alternative way of thinking and I've felt that this would really help all the object oriented programmers to become a better programmer.
